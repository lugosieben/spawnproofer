# Spawnproofer

**Spawnproof your world with a simple, intuitive and efficient Overlay!**

This mod adds an overlay on top of all spawnable blocks, which lights up green when mobs cannot spawn there at night, and red if mobs will spawn there at night.

## Usage

Use the keybind (F6 by default) or `/spawnproofer` to toggle.

## Configuration

Use Mod Menu or `/spawnproofer config` to enter the config.
